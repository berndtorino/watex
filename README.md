This userscript adds LaTeX support to [WhatsApp 
Web](https://web.whatsapp.com).

It's tested in Firefox (Developer Edition) 52 with Greasemonkey 3.9 and 
Chromium 55 with Tampermonkey 4.2.7.

LaTeX is parsed when it's enclosed in $...$ or \\(...\\) (inline) and 
$$...$$ or \\[...\\] (displayed)

This script uses [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX) for rendering.
